# Parallax Boxes Menu

Parallax scrolling is a special scrolling technique used in web design where **background images throughout a web page move slower than foreground images**, creating an illusion of depth on a two-dimensional site.

HTLM5 and CSS were used.

 - **index.html** contains a menu that have incorporated parallax scrolling
 - **contact.html** is a simple contact form design
 - **coming-soon.html** contains a countdown made in Javascript
